🌍 GeoAid – Smart Crisis Mapping & Aid Delivery Platform
GeoAid is a real-time crisis response and aid coordination platform built using the Google Maps Platform. It helps NGOs, local governments, and relief organizations map disaster zones, optimize delivery routes, and track resources during emergencies such as floods, pandemics, or natural disasters.

📌 Problem It Solves
In most disaster situations, responders face 3 key challenges:

Where is help needed most?

What is the best way to get there?

What resources are nearby and available?

Traditional systems don’t provide the real-time, location-based intelligence needed to make fast, informed decisions. GeoAid bridges that gap.

🔧 What It Does
🔥 Maps live crisis zones using heatmaps and GPS data

🚑 Optimizes aid delivery routes based on urgency, distance, and road conditions

🏥 Finds nearby hospitals, shelters, and pharmacies using Places API

🛻 Tracks vehicles and volunteers in real time

📴 Works offline for responders in low-connectivity areas

📱 Mobile-first experience for field workers

📊 Dashboard view for coordinators and managers
